# What Interests Me

I was born in the Bay Area, so I've spent my entire life in Silicon Valley. I was also born in a community of Indian Americans, so I've also had most of the adult figures in my life work in either the programming or engineering sector. A year ago, my local politician introduced a bill to fight caste discrimination in the workplace, and surprisingly, most of the older Indian immigrants (middle aged to older) vehemently dismissed the bill and called it a waste of time. Which contrasted the younger workers I spoke to, who were relieved it was finally being addressed. It's a fascinating example of the rift between the two generations of workers.

I'm not surprised of the existance and persistance of the caste system considering the amount of Indian immigrants that make Silicon Valley their home. - Seo Kwak
